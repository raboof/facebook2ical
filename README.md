# facebook2ical

This is a small application that fetches Facebook events for some page and formats them as an iCalendar format

Unfortunately, since Facebook disabled the events api, this utility is now useless.

[the facebook events api page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/events/) currently shows 'This is a restricted edge. You cannot request access at this time'. When this is un-restricted, this utility will be useful again.
