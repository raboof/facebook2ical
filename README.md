# facebook2ical

This is a small application that fetches Facebook events for some page and formats them as an iCalendar format

Unfortunately, since Facebook disabled the events api, this utility is now useless.
The API might be available again when you enable 'Page Public Content Access' for
your 'app'. This requires attaching your app to your 'verified facebook business
account', which requires you to be registered as an actual business. I don't really
have an intention to do so, so I'm not currently planning to explore this further.
Contributions welcome :)
